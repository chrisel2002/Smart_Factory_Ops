# Smart Factory Ops â€“ Predictive Maintenance & Business Intelligence Suite

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement
In manufacturing, unplanned equipment failures lead to costly downtime, safety risks, and reduced production efficiency. Traditional preventive maintenance schedules are often time-based, not condition-based, resulting in over-maintenance or unexpected breakdowns.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build an end-to-end data-driven solution that predicts machine failures using real-time telemetry data.
- Integrate advanced analytics and machine learning to enable predictive maintenance.
- Provide actionable business insights through dashboards and Power BI reports.
- Demonstrate how data can improve decision-making and process optimization in a smart manufacturing context.

## ðŸ§  Tools & Technologies
| Layer | Tools & Technologies |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, Tailwind, Recharts |
| **Backend** | Node.js (Express), REST API |
| **Data & ML** | Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), R (RMarkdown for EDA), MATLAB (Signal Processing) |
| **Database** | MySQL |
| **Business Intelligence** | Power BI |
| **Other Tools** | Docker, Git, GitHub, VS Code |

## ðŸš€ Expected Outcome
A working predictive maintenance and BI suite that:
- Reduces downtime and maintenance costs.
- Offers interactive dashboards for operational and executive decision-making.
- Demonstrates integration between analytics, development, and business intelligence tools.
